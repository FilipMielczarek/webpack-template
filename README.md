# Webpack template

The repository is the starting point for creating pages using the webpack. The whole thing was based on the guide created by [Swashbuckling with Code](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwashbucklingwithCode/videos).

## Installation and use
After cloning the repository, you must use the command

```
yarn install
```

and then

```
yarn build
```
After creating the build, run the attached HTML file. If the page looks like the description on the page, it all worked.
